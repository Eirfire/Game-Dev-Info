# An introduction 
This page is to give an understanding of game dev and what it kind of takes to do game dev


## How to get started:
Read All the start items below before actually getting started. 
1. A Computer or laptop that can run Unity most laptops will run untiy but may be a bit slow
2. setup unity i recommend folling this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewiw2tcfen8
    - he uses visual Studio but just use visual Studio code instead 
    - you won't need to worry about licensing just use te free version
3. Download and install [unity](https://unity.com/download) You'll need an account so just sign up for that it's all free
4. Download a Code IDE i recommend:
    * [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is Easy to use and setup and is what i use for unity and my coding
    * [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) is Harder to setup but is recommened for C# but not necessary

Once you finished with the setup you probably want to get straight into the game dev part but sadly it's a not that easy. It takes time to learn unity and how to code but don't let this deter you it's all part of the fun.




## To learn coding i recommend 2 places 

1. Brackeys youtube channel which has a part on C# click [here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPV2KyIb3jR4CtEelGPsmPzlvP7ISPYzR) to have a look
2. [SoloLean](https://www.sololearn.com/) which is free besides running code all you need is create an account this is where i've learnt most of my cosing from

## To Learn Unity i recommend
[Brackeys youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/Brackeys) is one of the best places and how is how i learnt Unity. He has quite a few playlists on creating different games but this one is the best: [How to make a videogame](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPV2KyIb3jR53Jce9hP7G5xC4O9AgnOuL) and is quite simple to follow and at the end you have a cool game that you can play and show your friends
